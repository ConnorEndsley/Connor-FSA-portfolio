            <p>I currently work at UT Southwestern Medical Center as a Research Assistant where I have been for the past 3 years.
               I intend to become a backend developer once completing the Fullstack Academy Bootcamp!

                <p>My current interests include traveling with my significant other and learning new programming languages.
                <p> Within the past few years I have been fortunate to be able to travel the country and intend to travel more internationally when borders begin to open up.
                I am starting to learn new programming languages to help better my future career.

               In my free time I enjoy playing video games with friends
               catching up on the best that reality TV has to offer with
               my significant other, and playing disc golf with friends.
                </p>
                <p>I have loved playing games for as long as I can remember, they are a way to wind down and escape the worries of daily life!</p>
                <p>My significant other recently started to get me into reality TV with her and I cannot find it in me to stop.</p>
                <p>Disc golf has been an enjoyable outdoor activity that I have loved playing since high school. I still frequent the course in my hometown.</p>
